# Copy post content

This plugin allows you to easily copy the content of a WordPress post directly from the single post page.

I’ve developed two versions of this plugin:

1. copy-post-content – Built using vanilla JavaScript.
2. copy-post-content-clipboardjs – Built using the Clipboard.js library.

Both plugins serve the same purpose and function effectively. You can choose either one based on your preference or technical needs, but please use only one plugin at a time on your website.
